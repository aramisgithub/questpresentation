# reward

## Mulan

- Instead of the \alert{reward} going to the hero, it goes to the
  \alert{others} in the army after they realise Mulan is female

- The reward consists of \alert{beating} the Huns and \alert{not perishing}

- Mulan is \alert{left to die} in the snow with Mushu, the cricket and her
  horse

## Odyssey

      home

    - I like it!

    - More \alert{epic} in general

# the road back

## Mulan

- Mulan realises most of the Huns did \alert{not die} in the avalanche after
  all, and decides to make her way towards the Imperial Palace

  others that the Huns are in fact \alert{not dead}, and that they are there,
  trying to \alert{murder} the Emperor

## Odyssey

- Unlike other heroes, Odysseus was \alert{not} in search of \alert{treasure}

- Instead, he was desperately trying to \alert{reach} his \alert{home}

- Once he returns, he finds out that his \alert{house} has been \alert{overrun}
  with suitors trying to steal his wife and palace

## Comparison

- Mulan

    - In this case, Mulan's story is much more \alert{dramatic} and
      \alert{heroic}

    - Trying to save China!

- Odyssey

    - Much more \alert{noble}

    - \alert{Not} as dramatic

    - \alert{Lower} stakes

# resurrection

## Mulan

- No one believes her, because they believe that Mulan \alert{cannot be
  trusted} as she had already \alert{lied} to them before

- The Huns reveal themselves, and the remaining members of the army, directed
  by the captain, attempt to \alert{ram} the Imperial Palace's doors open,
  \alert{to no avail}

- Mulan eventually \alert{convinces} all members of the army to \alert{join
  her} in her plan to disguise themselves as women

- Mulan's plan \alert{succeeds}, and she is \alert{rewarded} by the Emperor by
  being offered a seat on the Imperial Council, which she declines

## Odyssey

- Instead of rushing in and killing the suitors, Odysseus is \alert{patient}

- He wishes to learn if his \alert{wife} has been \alert{faithful}

- With the help of his son and a loyal swineherd, he devises a plan

  undetected

- Telemachus steals all the suitors’ weapons, and a \alert{final test} is
  proposed

- Penelope will marry the man who strings Odysseus' bow and shoots an arrow
  through a line of small circles; a seemingly \alert{impossible} task

## Comparison

- Mulan

    - Much more \alert{dramatic}

    - \alert{Not} very \alert{patient} or \alert{mature}

- Odyssey

    - Very \alert{mature} way to handle situation

    - \alert{Cunning}

- Implies that Odysseus is \alert{mature} and \alert{clever}, while Mulan's
  plan is just \alert{brute force} with a bit of disguising

# return with the elixir

## Mulan

- Instead, the Emperor hands Mulan a \alert{sword} and a \alert{necklace}

- Mulan \alert{returns} home with the captain in tow to the \alert{delight} of
  her family

- Mulan's family is also \alert{impressed} with the gifts Mulan received

## Odyssey

- Odysseus, still dressed as a beggar, completes the task and is
  \alert{restored} to his original state

- He and his son \alert{expel} the suitors from their home by \alert{force}

- Penelope, seeing how Odysseus has changed, \alert{tests} him to make sure it
  is \alert{actually him}

- She tells him she moved their bed

- He replies, correctly, that this would have been impossible, and all is
  \alert{returned to normal}

## Comparison

- Both \alert{noble} and \alert{dramatic}

- Odyssey slightly \alert{more} dramatic IMHO

- Mulan scenario very \alert{unrealistic}

- Assuming all mystical creatures are real, Odyssey scenario quite
  \alert{realistic}

# archetypes

- In the movie Mulan, Mushu \alert{helps} her by \alert{cheering} her
  \alert{spirit} and gives her \alert{confidence}

  \alert{help}

## The Dream Person

## Similarities

  \alert{not fight} for the war

- In comparison, the lotus eaters are native to their land and \alert{help} the
  Odyssey crew with the 'lotus' fruits

- In comparison, Poseidon \alert{tricks} Odysseus many times getting him into
  frustrating situations

## The Herald

- The herald in Oyssey is the \alert{starting} \alert{of} the \alert{war} in Troy---This conforms to the archetype because it tells Odysseus to \alert{go to war}

- The herald in Mulan is \alert{Mushu} and the \alert{Consul} of the Emperor---He conforms to the archetype by \alert{telling the news} to the Captain

## Similarities
