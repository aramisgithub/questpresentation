# Ordinary world

## Mulan

Honor is vital in Mulan. As Mulan dishonours her family, she does not fit into
the traditional female values that all must adhere to. Mulan is also clumsy and
embarrasses herself in front of the matchmaker, which also both go against the
values.

## Odyssey

King Odysseus is at home in Ithaca, with his wife, Penelope, and newborn son,
Telemachus. The King is well-liked and respected, which give him pride and
happiness.

## Comparison

While Odysseus is full of pride and honor, and is respected by his people,
Mulan is clumsy and is not respected by her her family. These are polar
opposites already.

# Call to adventure

## Mulan

Mulan witnesses her father being conscripted, and immediately realises that he
will die in war. She decides to disguise herself as a male to save her father.

## Odyssey

Odysseus sets out for the war in Troy.

## Comparison

Odysseus' motivation is to save his people, while Mulan's motivation for
adventure is saving her father.

# Refusal of the call

## Mulan

Mulan doubts her disguising abilities and almost gives up in front of the
training camp, but Mushu convinces her to go, despite her fears that she will
be uncovered.

## Odyssey

Odysseus does not want to leave his family and sail to Troy because he knows it
will be a long trip. He worried that something bad might occur during his trip.

## Comparison

While Mulan fears for herself, the confident Odysseus fears for others. This
clearly demonstrates that Odysseus believes in himself, while Mulan does not.

# Meeting with the mentor

## Mulan

The captain fills the role of the Mentor in Mulan, who is inspired by his
ridiculing of the soldiers to improve her battle skills and not fall behind the
others. She is determined to excel in the new life that she has found.

## Odyssey

Athena, the goddess of wisdom, crafts, and battle is Odysseus' guide. Sh wants
to help Odysseus, though she has been instructed not to by the other gods. She
takes pity on him while other gods forsake Odysseus for this very reason.
Athena constantly saves him from death while giving him guidance.

## Comparison

Mulan does not have a person that constantly guards her, while Odysseus does.
This may be an indication that Odysseus' struggles will be so much more
difficult that he needs others to guard him, unlike Mulan whose childish little
"adventures" do not really amount to much.

# Crossing the threshold

## Mulan

After getting into he swing of things and getting better and better at being
a warrior, Mulan comes to be respected by the others in the army for her skill
and sportsmanship.

## Odyssey

After the war, the gods become angry with the Greeks for their prideful ways.
Indeed, the gods are *so* angry that they form a great storm which emerges and
throws the Greeks off course. The gods sure do hate those Greeks!

## Comparison

Odysseus and his crew do not really have a real threshold to cross, while Mulan
does. The fact that the Odyssey does *not* have a threshold might signal that
the threshold is so drawn out that it isn't noticed. The threshold being drawn
out may also suggest that the rest of the journey will be more laborious and
arduous.

# Tests, allies, enemies

## Mulan

Mulan improves her skills and becomes even better at being male in a montage
with a catchy song that Harrison seems to really enjoy (*Let's get down to
buissness---To defeat---The Huns!*)


## Odyssey

Odysseus is faced with many tests as he travels back to Ithaca which include
many of the famous and well-known Greek mythological creatures in popular
culture. This list of creatures includes the Lotus Eaters, the Sirens and also
Scylla.

## Comparison

The fact that Mulan had to endure only vague "montage-y" tests, allies, enemies
in the form of training implies that Mulan's journey will be soft and easy.
This is in direct contrast to the Odyssey's journey, which has real
life-or-death scenarios, and is more serious than the tests found in Mulan.

# Approach to the innermost cave

## Mulan

The army that Mulan is a part of travels to a village the Huns decimated after
being tricked by Mushu into going to war with the Huns.

## Odyssey

Odysseus nearly makes it home, but unfortunately for him and his crew they open
a bag that had been given to Odysseus by Aeolus, god of the winds. The bag
released a wind that blew them far away from Ithaca after it was sadly opened.

## Comparison

The Approach is much more subdued in Mulan, and feels "set" and "official" due
to the government involvement in the whole situation. The very fact that the
military is involved in an organised and official manner subdues the entire
situation because it feels  like the government is keeping everyone safe. The
Odyssey's Approach could not be a more direct polar opposite to the one found
in Mulan. It is spontaneous, surprising, and completely unregulated. It is also
more dangerous, which sets the tone for the Supreme Ordeal that lies ahead.

# Supreme ordeal

## Mulan

Mulan's army is ambushed by the Huns who are hiding behind the summit of the
mountain. At first it seems that all hope is lost, but then Mulan saves
everyone by firing a rocket into an overhang of snow, causing an avalanche.
Almost all members of the army and the Huns are buried in the snow, never to be
seen again (or so we think...). As Mulan was firing the rocket, she is stabbed
by Shang Yu, the leader of the Huns. After the avalanche has passed, other
members of the army tend to Mulan's wound, undressing her. They realise that she
is a female!

## Odyssey

Odysseus is sent to the underworld seeking information to guide him home, which
unfortunately brings him to the verge of death!

## Comparison

Mulan sustains little damage, having only suffered a small gash, while Odysseus
is brought to the *verge of death*! That is comparatively huge personal damage.
The storyline is, in general, much more extreme and serious in the Odyssey.

# Reward

## Mulan

As Mulan does not yet receive a reward, the rules must be bent slightly to
allow the reward to go to the others in the army after they realise Mulan is
female. As this reward is in a more unorthodox sense, you might be wondering
what the reward consists of. Well, it consists of beating the Huns and not
perishing! Lame, I know. Under normal circumstances, Mulan would be executed,
but her life is spared due to her spectacular performance and, you know,
*saving everyone*! To reach a middle ground between *being executed* and
staying in the army (which are both unacceptable outcomes), Mulan is left to
die in the snow with Mushu, the cricket and her horse.

## Odyssey

The King of Phaeacia gives Odysseus passage home.

## Comparison

The reward in Mulan is vague, and cannot really be classified as reward. Again,
this is completely contrary to the reward in the Odyssey, which is as
traditional as a reward can get. On another note, the Odyssey is much more epic
in general, as goes for any story in which powerful kings of faraway lands lead
a classic hero home.

# The road back

## Mulan

Mulan glimpses some of the Huns rising out of the snow, and realises most of
the Huns did not die in the avalanche after all, and must make her way towards
the Imperial Palace. She deliberates for a while whether she should just go
home or save China, but decides that saving China is the only proper option.
Mulan arrives at the Imperial palace and attempts to convince the others from
the army that the Huns are in fact not dead, and that they are there, trying to
murder the Emperor.

## Odyssey

Unlike other heroes, Odysseus was not in search of treasure. Instead, he was
desperately trying to reach his home. Once he returns, he finds out that his
house has been overrun with suitors trying to steal his wife and palace.

## Comparison

In this extremely rare case, Mulan's story is much more dramatic and heroic,
while incorporating some grand and *creative* ideas (Trying to save China!
Yeah!) The Odyssey's Road Back is much more noble than Mulan's, as Mulan is
dumped by her friends while Odysseus is desperately trying to find his home to
make sure his wife and son are alright. Admittedly, the idea of someone trying
to return to their family is not nearly as dramatic or interesting as a brave
woman who was kicked out of the military for being female while trying to save
her father. Plus, the stakes are much lower in the Odyssey (All of China versus
one family)

# Resurrection

## Mulan

No one believes her, because they believe that Mulan cannot be trusted as she
had already lied to them before. The Huns reveal themselves, and take the
Emperor hostage within his own palace. Some of the Huns are guarding the doors
from inside the palace. The remaining members of the army, directed by the
captain, attempt to ram the Imperial Palace's doors open, but to no avail.
Mulan eventually convinces all members of the army to join her in her plan to
disguise themselves as women, sneak into the palace, assault the Huns and free
the Emperor. Mulan's plan succeeds, and she is rewarded by the Emperor by being
offered a seat on the Imperial Council, which she politely declines.

## Odyssey

Instead of rushing in and killing the suitors, Odysseus is patient. He wishes
to learn if his wife has been faithful. With the help of his son and a loyal
swineherd, he devises a plan. Athena disguises him as an old beggar so that he
can enter his house undetected. Telemachus steals all the suitors’ weapons, and
a final test is proposed. Penelope will marry the man who strings Odysseus' bow
and shoots an arrow through a line of small circles; a seemingly impossible
task

## Comparison

The situation in Mulan is much more dramatic, but is a childish, impatient and
immature plan that would not have a chance of working in real life. Once more,
a complete antithesis is presented by the Odyssey in the form of a mature,
realistic and clever way to handle a plausible situation (ignoring all magic
and mythical creatures of course). The plan being mature and clever implies
that Odysseus is mature and clever, while Mulan's plan is just brute force with
a bit of disguising and imagination.

# Return with the elixir

## Mulan

Because Mulan didn't accept the Emperor's gift of a seat on the council, the
Emperor hands her a sword and a necklace instead. Mulan's family had always
longed for her to get into a relationship, so they are delighted when Mulan
returns home with the captain in tow. Obviously, Mulan's family is also
extremely impressed with the gifts she received (who wouldn't be?!).

## Odyssey

Odysseus, still dressed as a beggar, completes the task and is restored to his
original state. He and his son expel the suitors from their home by force.
Penelope, seeing how Odysseus has changed, tests him to make sure it is
actually him. She tells him she moved their bed, to which he replies correctly
that this would have been impossible, and all is returned to normal.

## Comparison

Both scenarios are noble and dramatic, but it could be argued that the Odyssey
is slightly more dramatic. Mulan's scenario is very unrealistic, while,
assuming all mystical creatures are real, the Odyssey scenario is quite
realistic after all.

# Archetypes

## The Shadow

In the Odyssey, the most prominent Shadow-like character is Poseidon, who
conforms to his archetype by always creating trouble for Odysseus. The Shadow
in Mulan, on the other hand, is Shang Yu. He conforms to his archetype because
he is the leader of the Huns, and it goes without saying that *he is evil*.

## Similarities

So, some similarities. Both of the characters are villains, in that they both
harm, or, at least attempt to harm, the hero. In the Odyssey, Poseidon isn't
the main threat to Odysseus---the main focus for everyone is still the
war---but Poseidon still causes trouble throughout the journey. Poseidon is
more cunning and mischievous than your traditional Shadow. In comparison, Shang
Yu is not exactly the sharpest knife in the drawer, but is quite big and
strong.

## The Hero(ine)

In most tales of the Hero's Quest the hero or heroine is the main character and
pushes the story forward, saving many lives in the process. Odysseus fits this
mold almost perfectly. Mulan, on the other hand, does not really fit into the
whole "loved by their family" and "respected by everyone" cliché, but she is
still a hero because she saved the whole of China.

## Similarities

Mulan is introduced as a free-spirited outcast, clumsy, and unable to follow
rules, regulations, or traditions. Nevertheless, she has a warm heart and wants
nothing more than to uphold her family honor, while keeping true to herself.
Perhaps Mulan's flaws are her greatest strength because they help the moviegoer
to identify with the main character, maybe because they have the same faults as
Mulan. Nevertheless, Odysseus has two major flaws:

    - Arrogance

    - Pride

In comparison, Mulan is very selfless and puts others before her. The parallels
between  the two characters could not be more symmetric: Mulan has more faults
than Odysseus, but they are far easier to identify with due to the nature of
the faults. The exact opposite is true for Odysseus: his faults are ones no one
would be happy owning up to, and the people that have these faults would not be
inclined to admitting anything wrong with themselves anyway.

## The Hermit/Helper/Mentor

There is often a helper or mentor in a Hero's Quest. The mentor or helper must
always aid the hero in their quest for the elixir. The helper in Odyssey is
Goddess Athena, who conforms to her archetype by helping through the journey.
The helper in Mulan also conforms to the archetype, but in a different way.
Mushu, the helper in Mulan guides her and helps her as a helper should do, but
he is also cunning and accidentally (or maybe on purpose) starts a war between
Mulan's army and the Huns by tricking the consul into thinking that the army
was needed at the battlefront, even though they really weren't. Mushu also
helps Mulan by convincing her to not give up and to overcome the Threshold.

## Similarities

The characters in both help the protagonist, but in different ways: Mushu helps
Mulan by cheering her spirit and gives her confidence, while Athena sends
Odysseus divine aid and help.

## The Dream Person

Almost all works of fiction of any kind are partial to some romance, but what
better time to be romantic than during an epic quest to find the lost elixir!
The dream person in Odyssey is Penelope, who conforms to the archetype of the
dream person by being married to Odysseus. The dream person in Mulan is much
less cemented than the marriage that can be found in the Odyssey, as the dream
person in Mulan does not reveal their true nature until the very end of the
movie. The Captain conforms to the archetype by liking Mulan, and Mulan liking
him back.

## Similarities

Odysseus is married to Penelope whereas Mulan and the Captain aren't. There
aren't many other notable differences.

## The Threshold Guardian(s)

The threshold guardians play the role of those that make sure the hero is ready
to enter the Special World. The threshold guardians in the Odyssey are the
Lotus Eaters, who test Odysseus' strength and ability to problem solve by
making his men forget about home. The threshold guardians in Mulan are the
ancestors, who conform to their archetype by not being real people and guiding
Mushu to help Mulan.

## Similarities

In Mulan, the threshold guardians want to bring her back to not fight for the
war. In comparison, the Lotus Eaters are native to their land and help the
Odyssey crew with the 'lotus' fruits.

## The Tricker

The tricker in Odyssey is Poseidon, who conforms to his archetype by tricking
Odysseus throughout the adventure. The tricker in Mulan is Mushu, who conforms
to his archetype by lying to the consul and in general causing mayhem.

## Similarities

In Mulan, Mushu tricks the consul to go to war, but he doesn't manage to harm
Mulan in any way, while Poseidon tricks Odysseus many times in harmful ways by
getting him into frustrating situations.

## The Herald

The herald is the character that warns the other characters of an oncoming
danger or challenge. The herald in the Odyssey is the starting of the war in
Troy. This conforms to the archetype because it tells Odysseus to go to war.
The herald in Mulan is Mushu and the Consul of the Emperor. He conforms to the
archetype by telling the "news" to the Captain.

## Similarities

In Mulan, Mushu lied about going to war; the news was fake, while in the
Odyssey, the starting of the war warned everyone to stay.
